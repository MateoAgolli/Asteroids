# Asteroids
A classic Asteroids-inspired game built with JavaFX. The game involves controlling a spaceship that must avoid and destroy asteroids while collecting power-ups. The goal is to survive as long as possible while dodging incoming asteroids.

## Features
- Classic Asteroids gameplay with rotating and moving spaceship.
- Asteroids that move across the screen and spawn randomly.
- Lives are represented as "armors" that can be lost when colliding with asteroids.
- Armors can be picked up when they spawn, providing extra protection.
- Power-up in the form of a huge laser blast that destroys asteroids.
- Scoring system to track progress.
- Sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Asteroids.git
   
Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).  
Run the project using your IDE or by compiling it from the command line.  
If you prefer to play directly, you can download the "Asteroids_Setup.exe" file from the [Releases](https://github.com/MateoAgolli/Asteroids/releases) section and run it.

## How to play
```
• Shoot asteroids to earn points. You get 10 points for every asteroid you destroy.  
• You have 3 armors. If all armors are destroyed, the game is over.  
• Armors can appear randomly within each 1000-point interval if you have fewer than 3. Collect them to stay in the game!  
• Every 500 points, the number of asteroids and their speed increases.  
• When you reach 1000 points, you will start shooting two blasts at the same time instead of one.  
• A laser blast power-up will appear randomly within each 1000-point interval. Pick it up to unleash a powerful laser attack!  
• Control your spaceship:  
                                          - Move forward with W or Up Arrow  
                                          - Rotate left with A or Left Arrow  
                                          - Rotate right with D or Right Arrow  
                                          - Shoot with Spacebar  
```
